# Chirpy Starter

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jekyll-theme-chirpy)][gem]&nbsp;
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cotes2020/chirpy-starter.svg?color=blue)][mit]

When installing the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders
`_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets`, as well as a small part of options of the `_config.yml` file
from the theme's gem. If you have ever installed this theme gem, you can use the command
`bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate these files.

The Jekyll team claims that this is to leave the ball in the user’s court, but this also results in users not being
able to enjoy the out-of-the-box experience when using feature-rich themes.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, you need to copy the other critical files from the theme's gem to your
Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the
latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of
the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.

## Installation

Sign in to GitHub and [**use this template**][use-template] to generate a brand new repository and name it
`USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

Then clone it to your local machine and run:

```console
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Please see the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).

The startup template for [**Jekyll Theme Chirpy**][chirpy].

When installing the Chirpy through [RubyGems][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders `_includes`, `_layout`, `_sass` and `assets`, as well as a small part of options of the `_config.yml` file from the theme's gem (use the command `bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate). To fully use all the features of Chirpy, you also need to copy other files/directories and config options from the theme's gem to your Jekyll site. So we extract all the required things of the theme's gem to help you quickly use Chirpy.

```shell
# The critical files/directories to run Chirpy theme
├── _data
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
├── _config.yml
├── app.js
├── feed.xml
├── index.html
├── robots.txt
├── sw.js
└── 404.html
```

## Installation

[Use this template][usetemplate] to generate a new repository, and then execute:

[usetemplate]: https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate

```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Creare a new file `/assets/css/style.scss` in your Jekyll site.

And then add the following content:

---

@import {{ site.theme }}

// add your style below
```

### Changing the Number of Tabs

When adding or deleting files in the `_tabs` folder, you need to complete the section [Customing Stylesheet](#customing-stylesheet) first, and then add a new line before `@import`:
>>>>>>> 7a2365c (Update the site config according to the theme (v3.1.0))
